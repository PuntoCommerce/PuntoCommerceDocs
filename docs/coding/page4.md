## PERT Estimation Formula

The PERT formula is used to estimate the probable duration of a task in project management. It takes into account three estimates: optimistic estimate (O), most likely estimate (M), and pessimistic estimate (P) to calculate a weighted estimate (E).

The formula to calculate the weighted estimate (E) in PERT is as follows:

Where:

- O is the optimistic estimate (best-case scenario).
- M is the most likely estimate (the most realistic estimate based on reality and experience).
- P is the pessimistic estimate (worst-case scenario).
  The PERT calculation assumes that the estimates follow a Beta distribution and uses a specific weighting to combine these three estimates. By using this formula, we aim to have a more accurate and realistic estimate by considering both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.

It's important to note that the PERT Formula is a tool to assist in estimation, and real-world outcomes may vary. Communication and close monitoring of project progress are essential to adjust the estimates as needed throughout the project.

It's important to note that this formula is typically used once all the requirements for the task to be estimated are completed, providing a more accurate prediction of the task duration.
